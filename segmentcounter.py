#******Before beginning, open terminal and run "sudo pip install smbus2"******
#* Run "sudo i2cdetect -y 1" to ensure that the device is detected by your I2C
#******This project identifies the installed device under address "0x22"
#  yours may be different, if so then change anywhere addressed to "0x22"
#  to the address presented when you run "Run "sudo i2cdetect -y 1"
